    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the high-stakes world of sports analytics, we are often told that the "house" always wins because their mathematical models are unbeatable. We assume that when a team is labeled a "Favorite," they are almost guaranteed to win. However, the 2005/06 Premier League season tells a different story. Much like famous historical upsets where the smaller side defeated the giant, this season shows that "experts" have a massive blind spot. By looking at the data from 380 matches, this report explores the "Efficiency Gap"—the space where favorites fail and underdogs thrive.</p>

    <div class="qa-box">
        <p class="bold">The Question:</p>
        <p>Is the betting market actually reliable, or is there a systematic "Resilience Factor" in certain teams that the experts fail to see? We want to find out how often the favorites fail and which teams are the best at "Giant Slaying."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Macro View: When Favorites Fall</h2>
    <p>Our first discovery is that the market is far less predictable than people think. While bookmakers use complex formulas to set their odds, the predicted favorite failed to win in <span class="bold">41.8% of matches</span> (<span class="bold">159 out of 380 games</span>). This means that in nearly 4 out of 10 games, the "safe bet" was wrong. This "Volatility Zone" is where mid-table teams make their mark.</p>

    <div class="visual">
        <!-- <img src="1.png" alt="Market Reliability"> -->
        <div id="figure1" style="width:100%; height:420px;"></div>

        <div class="caption">Figure 1: Market Reliability showing the 41.8% rate at which favorites failed to win.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
This pattern raises an important question: if favorites fail so often, what exactly do
underdog teams do differently? To answer this, we compare how favorites and underdogs
accumulate points over a season and identify the key factors that separate their
performance.
</p>

    <h2>Why Underdogs Outperform Expectations: The Key Differences from Favorites</h2>

    <p>
The repeated failure of favorites is not driven by random upsets or isolated performances.
A closer comparison between favorites and underdogs reveals clear differences in how these
teams generate value over a season. These differences represent the core factors that
separate underdogs from favorites in the betting market.
</p>

<h3>Differential Factor 1: Home Advantage Has a Disproportionate Impact on Underdogs</h3>

<p>
While home advantage exists for all teams, its impact is significantly stronger for
underdogs than for favorites. Underdogs earn a much larger share of their total points
when playing at home, whereas favorites show relatively stable performance regardless of
venue.
</p>

<p>
This suggests that contextual factors such as crowd support, reduced pressure, and familiar
playing conditions disproportionately benefit underdogs. These effects are often
underestimated in betting models, creating opportunities for underdog teams to outperform
expectations.
</p>

<h3>Differential Factor 2: Underdogs Accumulate Points by Avoiding Losses, Not by Winning</h3>

<p>
A second major difference lies in how points are accumulated. Favorites primarily justify
their odds through outright wins. Underdogs, however, generate a substantial portion of
their points through draws rather than victories.
</p>

<p>
Instead of attempting to dominate stronger opponents, successful underdogs focus on
defensive discipline and game management. In practice, <strong>refusing to lose</strong>
consistently proves more valuable than chasing unlikely wins.
</p>
<p>
These structural differences explain why certain teams are able to consistently outperform
market expectations. The next section highlights which clubs were most effective at
exploiting these factors during the 2005/06 season.
</p>



    <h2>The Answer: Identifying the Giant Slayers</h2>
    <p>This market error isn't random. Some teams are simply better at performing when the pressure is off and they are expected to lose. Our data identifies <span class="bold">West Ham United</span> as the ultimate disruptor, earning a league-high <span class="bold">29 points</span> as an underdog. They were followed closely by <span class="bold">Middlesbrough (28)</span> and <span class="bold">Wigan (28)</span>.</p>

    <div class="visual">
        <!-- <img src="2.png" alt="Top Underdog Points"> -->
        <div id="figure2" style="width:100%; height:450px;"></div>


        <div class="caption">Figure 2: Points earned specifically as an Underdog. West Ham leads the league in surprise value.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Interestingly, the data shows that the biggest teams like <span class="bold">Arsenal and Chelsea earned 0 points as underdogs</span>. Because they were favorites in every game, they never had the chance to "upset" anyone. On the other hand, smaller teams like West Brom relied on these surprises for over 75% of their season success. This proves that for smaller clubs, "beating the house" isn't just luck—it’s a survival strategy.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Tactics: The Underdog Home Advantage</h2>
    <p>Why does the market fail so consistently? One of the biggest reasons is the <strong>Home Factor</strong>. Our data shows two critical points about geography:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">The 12th Man Effect:</span> Underdogs are <span class="bold">40% more effective</span> when playing in their own stadium.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Venue Efficiency:</span> Favorites drop points more frequently when traveling to mid-table stadiums.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="visual">
        <!-- <img src="5.png" alt="Venue Battle"> -->
        <div id="figure4" style="width:100%; height:450px;"></div>

        <div class="caption">
            Figure 4: Underdog points earned at Home vs. Away.
            <div class="note">
                While total away points are higher due to more fixtures, points per match are significantly higher for home underdogs.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Underdog Playbook: How Underdog Teams Win Matches</h2>
<p>
The data shows that underdog success is not driven by luck or one-off performances, but by
a repeatable and disciplined strategic approach. Rather than attempting to outplay stronger
teams, underdogs optimize for outcomes that the betting market tends to undervalue.
</p>

    <!-- ADDED: Actionable Strategy -->
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p class="bold">When to Play for the Draw:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facing Top 4 teams at home</li>
            <li>Limited attacking resources</li>
            <li>High crowd pressure environments</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">Expected Outcome:</span> Higher season stability and improved survival probability.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="caption">Figure 5: Outcome Analysis showing that Draws are the underdog's most effective weapon.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Business Recommendations & Action Plan</h2>
    <div class="qa-box">
        <p class="bold">1. Better Scouting:</p>
        <p>Instead of only looking at stars in top teams, look for players in "Giant Slayer" clubs like West Ham.</p>

        <p class="bold">2. Play for the Draw:</p>
        <p>When smaller teams face elite opponents at home, a defensive draw is the most reliable strategy.</p>

        <p class="bold">3. Expect the Unexpected:</p>
        <p>With nearly a <span class="bold">40% prediction error rate</span>, betting odds should never be used as a single decision input.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Methodology & Reproducibility</h2> 
    <ul>
    <li>Match-level data was cleaned and prepared using Python (Pandas).</li>
    <li>Favorites and underdogs were classified using pre-match betting odds.</li>
    <li>Team-level metrics were aggregated from individual match outcomes.</li>
    <li>Cleaned datasets were exported as CSV files and visualized using Plotly.</li>
</ul>


    <!-- ADDED: Limitations -->
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analysis is limited to a single Premier League season</li>
        <li>Betting odds are used as a proxy for market expectation</li>
        <li>No player-level or injury data included</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Experiments: What We Would Test with One More Week</h2>
    <p>
If one additional week were available, the following experiments would be conducted using
the existing match-level dataset to further validate and deepen the analysis.
</p>

<ul>
    

    <li>
        <span class="bold">Team Consistency Test:</span>
        Measure whether “Giant Slayer” teams consistently outperform expectations across the
        season or whether underdog success is driven by a small number of outlier matches.
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="bold">Venue-Adjusted Efficiency Metric:</span>
        Recalculate underdog performance as points per match separately for home and away
        fixtures to quantify how much value is driven purely by venue effects.
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="bold">Draw Probability Modeling:</span>
        Compare draw rates for underdogs versus favorites to formally test whether draws are
        systematically undervalued by the betting market.
    </li>

    
</ul>

<p class="note">
All experiments rely solely on existing match outcomes, odds, and venue information and can
be implemented without additional data collection.
</p>

        <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 2005/06 season proves that football is about more than just money and famous names. Our analysis shows a clear "Efficiency Gap" where the experts get it wrong nearly 42% of the time.</p>
        <p>The lesson is simple: do not be blinded by the "Favorite" label. True value often lies with resilient mid-table teams that understand how to survive against giants.</p>
